title: Parametric approximation of functions via neural networks
====

I aim to develop better and more robust method of approximating real valued
functions of real variables using neural networks. The plan is to first use
this method to approximate well known non-trivial functions like the Airy
polynomials before moving on to more exotic functions.

Beyond that I hope to extend this method to solve differential equations. If
successful then that can help to develop the elusive closed form solutions of
differential equations like the Navier-Stokes equation.
